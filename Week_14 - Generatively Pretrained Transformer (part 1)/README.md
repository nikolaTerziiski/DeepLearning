# 🎯 Goals for week 14

1. Start to write out an implementation of a generatively pretrained transformer that can generate poems in the style of William Shakespeare.
2. Implement input embeddings and positional encodings of a generatively pretrained transformer.
3. Practice writing high quality code:
   1. Easy to read.
   2. Safe from bugs.
   3. Ready for change.

## Task 1

**Description:**

Explore the dataset we're going to use - the text file `shakespeare.txt`, present in our `DATA` folder:

1. Output the length of the dataset in characters.
2. Output the first $1000$ characters.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Output matches the one shown below.

**Test case:**

```console
python task01.py
```

```text
Number of characters: 1,115,394
First 1000 tokens:
First Citizen:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

All:
Speak, speak.

First Citizen:
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

All:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

First Citizen:
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
Is't a verdict?

All:
No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!

Second Citizen:
One word, good citizens.

First Citizen:
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance; our
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

```

## Task 2

**Description:**

Create the vocabulary. Output it and its size.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Output matches the one shown below.

**Test case:**

```text
Vocabulary: 
 !$&',-.3:;?ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Vocabulary size: 65
```

## Task 3

**Description:**

Create a tokenizer that can:

- take text and return a list of token ids.
- take a list of token ids and return the text that they form.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Output matches the one shown below.

**Test case:**

(The word `therre` is intentionally written like that.)

```console
python task03.py
```

```text
Encoding the text "hi therre": [46, 47, 1, 58, 46, 43, 56, 56, 43]
Decoding the encoded version of the text "hi therre": hi therre
```

## Task 4

**Description:**

Tokenize the dataset and store the result in a tensor.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Output matches the one shown below.

**Test case:**

```console

## Task 8

**Description:**

Create an bigram language model as discussed in `notes.md`. Pass the above generated batch to it and output:

- the shape of the logits.
- the value of the loss.

Answer the following question in a comment: *Compare the value of the loss with the baseline model - what can you conclude?*.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Output matches the one shown below.
2. A comment is present with an answer to the question in the description.

**Test case:**

```console
python task08.py
```

```text
Shape of logits: torch.Size([32, 65])
Loss: 4.724130153656006
```

## Task 9

**Description:**

Implement a functionality to generate from the model until a limit `max_new_tokens` is reached.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. The model can generate new text for any arbitrary length, specified by the user of the model.

**Test case:**

```console
python task09.py
```

```text

```

## Task 10

**Description:**

Change the batch size to $32$ and train the model for $N$ epochs (you decide what $N$ should be) and output the new generations.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. The generated text is a little bit more Shakespeare-like than it was in the previous task.

**Test case:**

```console
python task10.py
```

```text

## Task 11

**Description:**

Let's add a function for evaluating the model during training.

One evaluation loop would correspond to obtaining a batch of randomly sampled `xs` and `ys` from a certain data split and calculating the loss of the model.

Given that we're in the training loop, every `eval_interval` epochs, for the training and validation splits, perform `eval_iters` evaluation loops and report the average training and validation losses.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. New functionality is introduced that performs `eval_iters` evaluation loops every `eval_interval` epochs.

**Test case:**

If we set `eval_interval=300` and `eval_iters=200`, we should get something similar to:

```console
python task11.py
```

```text
Epoch 0: avg train loss 4.7627 | avg val loss 4.7633

## Task 12

**Description:**

Currently, we have a model that is a single layer. Our goal is to turn this model into a `Decoder` from the `Transformer` architecture.

Let's start moving in that direction by:

1. Adding a hyperparameter for the size of the embeddings and encodings.
2. Adding positional encodings.
3. Adding a linear layer that will take in the token encodings and produce the final output.

In more recent years the logic of the positional encodings has been simplified to just using another set of embedding weights. Let's follow this approach here - implement the positional encodings as an embedding table.

After adding the new layers repeat the experiment from the previous task and output the new results.

Having achieved this we're ready to continue with the self-attention blocks of the decoder in the next exercises!

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. The size of the input embeddings and positional encodings is configurable.
2. Positional encoding is implemented.
3. A linear layer is added to transform the hidden layer outputs into the possible classes.

**Test case:**

If we set the size of the embeddings and encodings to $32$ then we should get something similar to:

```console
python task12.py
```
