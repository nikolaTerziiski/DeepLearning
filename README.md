# Introduction to Deep Learning, Summer Semester 2024-2025

## Set up an environment for working with Jupyter Notebooks

Please follow the instructions in one of the following two folders:

1. [GuideForVisualStudioCode](./GuideForVisualStudioCode/) - for working in a local development environment.
2. [GuideForGoogleColab](./GuideForGoogleColab/) - for working using a remote Google Cloud session.

### Books

- If you are part of the Moodle class, you should have received more information about recommended books by Simo at the start of the semester.
- If you are part of the Moodle class, but haven't received anything, feel free to contact Simo via his email address.

## Don't be afraid to ask questions ðŸ˜Š

> ðŸ“Œ If you are struggling a lot with the tasks, don't hesitate to ask us for a `1-1 session` in-person or via Google Meet ðŸ˜‡!

and remember:

> He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool `forever`.

-Chinese Proverb

## Principles of this course

1. You learn as much as you want.
2. Be proactive.
3. Using generative AI is discouraged. Instead, try to research via Google on your own and read documentations of various libraries. You can also ask me, of course.
4. Using generative AI to solve the tasks, given in this course, is strongly discouraged.
5. We may not have enough time to go through all the planned material for each session. In such cases, please read the remainder on your own.
6. You'll get the solution of a task if you first try to solve it yourself.

## Frequently asked questions

### How will I be graded?

There will be two homeworks, an exam, a project defense and a discussion after the defense.

### What is "the discussion"?

- The discussion is done after the defense of the project on the date of the final exam.
- It forms **50%** of the final grade.
- If I'm available to tune in for the final, I'll be asking questions (some will be in an interview style) regarding the topics I've covered.
- Example questions:
  - Tell me everything you know about Transformers?
  - How can we deal with a model that is overfit?
  - What's an important step to do when splitting data for a classification problem?
- The complexity of the questions will be inversely proportional to the number of submitted "For Home" weeks. More submissions => easier questions (from my side).
  - I'll ask no questions if all "For Home" weeks are submitted.

### Will there be an exam focusing on theory?

No. The discussion after the project defense will play that role.

### When will project topics be provided?

Around a month before the finals start (i.e. somewhere in the beginning of May).

### Can I submit my own project idea?

Yes. There'll be a submission form for that. Note that in order for you to start working on your idea, it has to be approved by me.

### I'm not in the Moodle class. What do I do?

Everything is ok - we'll fix that. Just come and tell me or send me an email. I only need your faculty number.

### A friend of mine is not in the Moodle class. What do I do?

They have to come personally to me and tell me or send me an email with their faculty number.

### Can I use generative AI?

No. When you have questions, ask me - let's grow together, not separated.

### Why can't I use generative AI?

I prefer we share to each other when we have problems and try to solve them together. University is about growing together and is nested in genuine and sincere conversations. I stand beside you and want to be next to you whenever you're having difficulties.

There is nothing wrong in asking me questions.

There's a lot wrong with trying to fool me you know more than you do.

### What if I'm caught using generative AI?

Your work will be considered forged.

### What is `For Home`?

`For Home` is a system having the only goal of making sure you understand what we discuss and do in class.

Its essence:

- specially curated tasks that are present after each practice session;
- you solve them whenever you want to and have free time;
- you submit them before the next session over email (if you can't, drop me a line beforehand and all will be ok);
- I check your solutions and give either a `Yes` or feedback on what I would like us to work on;
- (iteration) you implement the feedback and submit again. I check and provide either `Yes` or feedback on what I would like us to work on;
- you reap the benefits the system provides: increase of grades up to `2` grade points for each homework, exam and final that you submit.

The most important characteristic of `For Home` is **iterative feedback**. Its goal is **not** to be a one-time-submission. It's goal is to make you a better data scientist and engineer via **iterative feedback**.

It's not as dumb as you may think and has great power to transform how you think, how fast you problem-solve and how you perform on other programming subjects.

> **Note:** You cannot submit `For Home` for week `n + i, i > 0`, if week `n` is not approved with `Yes`.

### How to submit `For Home`?

Only over email, using the already established email thread.

### What is the timeline for submitting `For Home`?

Think of it like a [scrum sprint](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints). Usually, a sprint is `2` weeks. Well, in our course, it is `1` week.

However, there are no problems if you cannot make it on time - just tell me.

### You are too mean and cause me psychological stress. How do I convey this to you?

This can definitely happen as it's more than certain that the feedback I'll give you:

- will be direct;
- will not focus much on what you did great;
- will focus a lot on what is not correct and has to be fixed.

**Tell me as soon as you see such signs. Come and talk to me in person.** I'll understand and correct my behavior.

Something which you may not accept is that whatever I do, I do it because I love you and want you to improve and go way beyond what you think is possible ðŸ’“. However, sometimes too many people use external help which in turn taints this.

### What if I'm having difficulties with tasks from `For Home`?

Option 1: You ask me in-person.

Option 2: We arrange a Google Meet.

Option 3: Skip these. Solve as much as you can. Write your idea for each of the tasks you couldn't solve: for each task answer the following questions in comments:

    1. What is the name of the procedure/function?
    2. How many parameters does it take?
    3. What is the type of the parameters?
    4. What are the names of the parameters?
    5. What is the return type?
    6. Break the task into smaller tasks. List them.

Then, you'll basically have a set of tasks that are solved and a set of tasks for which you've outlined what you want to do. You send these two sets over email.

### Does getting a `Yes` mean getting a `bonus`?

No. It means that I've approved the submitted code and you can continue with the next ones.

### Is it mandatory to submit `For Home`?

No. It's meant to increase your grade, but if you're fine without it, that's not a problem.

### If I do not submit `For Home`, do I get punished?

No. However, note that I have a very strict standard (code is easy to read, safe from bugs and ready for change). You'll be graded against it and without a bonus, you won't have the ability to make me "close my eyes" if something is not fulfilled.

### What do you suggest as the best approach to achieve the highest score in all exams and homeworks?

1. Learn by doing, rather than listening.
2. Do not use code generators.
3. Go through `notes.md` for the current week.
4. Try to solve as much tasks as you can from the section for the current week.
5. If you can't solve a task, skip it - continue with the rest.
6. After you've solved as much as you could, submit an email, highlighting what you tried and what your idea was.

### Can I use external help - for example, repos/solutions from other current/previous year students?

No. Just ask me when you need help. I'll help you more than everything you can access via Internet * `100`. Don't believe it - try me ^_^!
